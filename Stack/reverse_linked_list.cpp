//USING STACK TO REVERSE A LL

REVERSING LL

Recursive Solution (Here we are using IMPLICIT STACK, think of the diagram that will be a result of recursive function calls inside the stack)
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(n)

Iterative Solution
Time Complexity = O(n)
Space Complexity = O(1)
