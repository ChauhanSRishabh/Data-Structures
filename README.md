# Data-Structures
Implementing Data Structures in C/C++

## Concepts

###### ADT - Abstract Data Type
When we talk about a data structure as ADT, we only talk about the features/operations available with the data structure. We do not go into implementation details. So, basically we define the data structure as a mathematical/logical model.


## Stacks

###### Stack ADT
A list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can only be performed from one end, called **Top**

###### Operations
**Push** - Inserting an element into a stack.
**Pop** - Removing the most recent element from the stack.
